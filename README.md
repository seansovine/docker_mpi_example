# Docker Compose MPI Cluster

This project will be a simple Docker Compose configuration for an MPI cluster,
with each node defined by a Dockerfile that provides the environment
for OpenMPI to run in. The purpose is to provide a test environment for 
learning distributed computing with MPI on a single machine that is
easy to setup and reproduce.
